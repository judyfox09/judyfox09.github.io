Customizable indexing framework to support fast queries and analysis of interesting data subsets
IndexedHBase can achieve a query evaluation speed that is siginifcantly faster than using the existing indexing techniques provided by commercial NoSQL databases.

## Introduction
### Core Definition
- Advanced storage system extending HBase
- Features customizable indexing framework
- Focuses on efficient subset data analysis
- Built on YARN architecture

### Integration Capabilities
- Compatible with parallel computing platforms:
  - Hadoop MapReduce
  - Twister
- Supports efficient analysis of query results

### Performance Benefits
- Significantly faster query evaluation
  - 10-100 times faster than existing NoSQL solutions
  - Outperforms commercial databases like Riak
- Achieves speed through customized index structures

### Practical Applications
- Successfully implemented in:
  - Text Indexing (ClueWeb09)
  - LCIR Synonym Mining
  - Social Data Analysis (Twitter datasets)
