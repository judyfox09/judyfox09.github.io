## Introduction

- Financial time series forecasting in financial aid faces challenges due to limited data and complex trends.

- Big data analytics and *predictive analysis* are key approaches for financial forecasting.

- **Challenges in Financial Aid (FA) time series analysis:**
  - Limited historical datasets
  - High dimensional financial information
  - Balancing accuracy with computational efficiency

- **Proposed solution:**
  - Pre-trained foundation models
  - State-of-the-art time series models, including:
    - GPT-2 as the backbone LLM
    - Transformer architectures
    - Linear models

- **Advantages:**
  - Outperforms traditional methods
  - Effective with minimal (*few-shot*) or no fine-tuning (*zero-shot*)

- **Benchmark study:**
  - Covers financial aid and seven other time series tasks
  - Highlights LLMs' potential for scarce financial datasets
