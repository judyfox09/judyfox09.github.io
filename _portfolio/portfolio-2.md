## Introduction
- **Simplifications of MapReduce**:
  - Simplifies implementations of data parallel applications.
  - Widely adopted for its simplicity and service quality.
  - Extensions and enhancements expand applicability to more applications.

- **Features of Twister**:
  - Distinction between static and variable data.
  - Configurable long-running (cacheable) map/reduce tasks.
  - Communication and data transfer via pub/sub messaging.
  - Efficient support for **Iterative MapReduce computations** (much faster than Hadoop or Dryad/DryadLINQ).
  - Combine phase to aggregate reduce outputs.
  - Data access through local disks.
  - Lightweight design (~5600 lines of Java code).
  - Supports typical MapReduce computations.
  - Includes tools for managing data.

- **Development Context**:
  - Developed as part of Jaliya Ekanayake's Ph.D. research.
  - Supported by the SALSA Team at Indiana University (IU).
