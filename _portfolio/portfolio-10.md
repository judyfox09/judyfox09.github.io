## Showcase: salsaDPI in Science Cloud Summer School 2012

In the summer of 2012, Indiana University and other 9 university sites hosted a week-long virtual [Science Cloud Summer School](https://sciencecloudsummer2012.tumblr.com/schedule). This conference introduced cloud technologies and science applications to over 200 graduate students and staff participants across the nation. SalsaDPI was used as one of the cloud tools and contributed to a tutorial for reproducible environments. It has the ability to deploy both a single node (sandbox) and a virtual cluster. Also, it automatically executes Hadoop and Twister applications like WordCount and Kmeans after installing the selected software stack. The tutorial is available online. A video example of Hadoop WordCount can be accessed from [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=kWom0lj8qxI) (please view it with video quality of 1080p).
