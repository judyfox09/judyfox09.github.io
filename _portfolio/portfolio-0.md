# Introduction
**Equipment Malfunction Prediction and Alerts**  
Anomaly prediction can help engineers identify issues in the hardware before they become serious. Especially at the speed at which these cars travel, small issue can quickly snowball to become catastrophic.

**Recommendations with Evolving Driving Conditions**  
Track conditions are ever evolving, from humidity, ambient temperature and track temperature. All of these factors affect the way on-board systems perform in different ways. It can be hard for a human to take appropriate action at the appropriate time with such gradual change.

**Performance Tuning During Practice**  
Performance of hardware can be tuned to minute degrees based on insights provided by AI systems which can go beyond the level of pattern recognition capable by humans.



# Anomaly Detection

- **Applications**:
  - Video streams and sensor telemetry data assist in:
    - Increasing race safety.
    - Optimizing strategies for teams and drivers.
    - Improving analysis and predictions.
- **Task Priority**: Anomaly detection begins with object detection in video analytics.
- **Approach**:
  - Created new datasets tailored to IndyCar race cars.
  - Compared three Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) models from TensorFlow Detection Model Zoo.
  - Ran experiments on CPU, GPU, and Edge TPU (Google Coral Dev Board).
- **Findings**:
  - Edge TPU achieved the best inference time.
  - Best suited for real-time machine learning tasks due to reduced latency and efficient edge computing.

# Rank Forecasting
Rank position forecasting in car racing is a challenging problem. We propose RankNet, a combination of the encoder-decoder network and a separate Multilayer Perception network that is capable of delivering probabilistic forecasting to model the pit stop events and rank position in car racing. RankNet demonstrates a significant performance improvement.
