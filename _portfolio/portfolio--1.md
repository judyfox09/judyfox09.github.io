## Introduction
* Framework:
  * Combines sensitivity analysis with Google’s Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT).
  * Explains spatio-temporal features and model-learned patterns.

* Methodology:
  * Uses Morris Method to assess feature sensitivity.
  * Correlates Morris index with attention patterns for interpretation.

* Key Contributions:
  * Predicts COVID-19 cases at a county level with dynamic, detailed data.
  * Modified TFT outperforms the baseline Pytorch model.

* Dataset:
  * Covers 3142 US counties.
  * Static features: age, health disparity, industry.
  * Dynamic features: vaccination, spread, transmissible cases, social distancing.

* Results:
  * Accurately models complex interactions.
  * Provides interpretable insights for mitigation and response planning.
